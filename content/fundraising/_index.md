     The next concert in the 2023 series will be another of the perennially popular Young Musicians evenings, featuring <b>four of the amazingly talented singers and instrumentalists from Dean Close School</b>. The concert will take place in <b>York Barn, Tredington GL20 7BP</b> (not far from Tewkesbury). Those who attended the previous concerts will know that it’s a super venue and there’s ample parking. As ever, all proceeds will go to Philo funds. <b>Tickets cost a modest £10 to include supper and your first drink. Available now either through our [contact form](/contact.html), or at rehearsal.

      The next Supper Concert takes place on <strong>September 21st</strong> and will be given by Kathryn Jeffree, soprano and flute, and Gerry Walshe, baritone.

      The concert will take place in <strong>York Barn, Tredington GL20 7BP</strong> (not far from Tewkesbury). Those who have attended the previous concerts will know that it’s a super venue and there’s ample parking. As ever, <strong>all proceeds will go to Philo funds. Tickets cost a modest £10 to include supper and your first drink. Available now from Linda, either at rehearsal or by emailing conductor@philomusica.org.uk</strong>.

      The final concert of the year is on <strong>November 16th</strong> when the delightful chamber choir, Coro Camino, will sing a wide variety of short choral pieces.

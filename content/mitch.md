      The members of Philomusica have been saddened to learn of the death of our President and friend, John Mitchinson.

      Mitch, as he was widely known in the music profession, was born in Bolton. He studied at what is now the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Later, he was a pupil of the great British tenor, Heddle Nash. It’s surely no coincidence that Heddle Nash was the leading Gerontius of his age, just as Mitch became, in the opinion of many, the leading exponent of that role among his generation. 

      Like so many young singers of the time, Mitch began his career on the oratorio circuit, singing for choral societies all over the UK. One such engagement was a performance of Elijah. On that occasion Karl Jenkins’ father played the organ and the soprano soloist was Heather Harper. Of more significance for Mitch, though, was the fact that the mezzo soloist was a young Welsh singer named Maureen Guy, who he met for the first time that day. The rest, as they say, is history: they were married in 1958 and were parted only when Maureen died in February 2015. Maureen was a distinguished singer in her own right, a principal at the Royal Opera House and then with Frankfurt Opera. She and Mitch often appeared in concert together.

      Mitch sang all over the world. Later in his career he acquired a particular reputation for singing the very big, demanding tenor roles in Wagner operas and in such works as Janáček’s Glagolitic Mass and Schoenberg’s Gurrelieder. He was also peerless in the title role of The Dream of Gerontius. However, his repertoire was vast and he earned a justified reputation for versatility: he was equally adept, for example, in Verdi, Gilbert and Sullivan and operetta. He had an especial affinity with English song. Throughout his career he was willing to take on – and achieve great success in – roles that no one else would make the time to learn. In 1982 he gave an interview in Chicago and remarked, self-deprecatingly: “having done so many rarely-heard works for the BBC, I think I’ve got the biggest repertoire of useless roles of anybody in the world!”   

      Leading conductors regularly engaged Mitch as a soloist. He worked frequently with conductors of the calibre of Leonard Bernstein, Sir Adrian Boult, Jascha Horenstein, Kurt Masur and Sir Malcom Sargent. He enjoyed a particularly fruitful collaboration with Sir Simon Rattle in the 1980s and 1990s. Mitch appears on several of the acclaimed recordings that Rattle and the CBSO made together – including Elgar’s The Dream of Gerontius and Janáček’s Glagolitic Mass. Together they gave more than 100 concerts together.

      Those of us who had the good fortune to know Mitch will remember him not just for his singing but also for his sense of humour. He had an endless supply of jokes and anecdotes. He performed frequently with his great friend, the contralto Alfreda Hodgson, a very fine singer who died in 1992 at the tragically young age of 51. She and Mitch would often travel together when they were appearing together but eventually they decided they had better travel separately because they used to laugh so much during their journeys that there was a danger they’d arrive for rehearsal having  damaged their voices. Though Mitch was a very serious artist once the music-making began, sometimes his sense of humour would accompany him onto the platform. Before he went to study at the Northern College of Music, he worked for Barclays Bank for a year or so. The manager of the branch where Mitch had his short banking career eventually rose to quite a high rank in Barclays. Through him, many years later, came the invitation to Mitch to give a concert in London for the bank. Typically, Mitch couldn’t resist opening his programme with Roger Quilter’s song ’Fair House of Joy’, which begins with the words ‘Fain would I change that note…’ Apparently, many in the audience got the joke.

      Not content with a long and distinguished performing career, Mitch was, like so many other musicians, keen to give back. He did this through teaching, passing on his vast experience and technical knowledge. His prime teaching appointment was at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, where he was Head of Vocal Studies until his retirement in 1997. (Maureen also taught at the College at the same time.) In addition, Mitch was keen to inspire younger singers and, beginning in 2000, for a good number of years he taught students at Dean Close School in Cheltenham for a couple of days each week. Even when he and Maureen retired to West Wales, he kept up the Dean Close connection, driving the long distance each week to do so. And he was just as encouraging to amateurs: he gave a couple of masterclasses for Philomusica. It was a daunting prospect to sing to such a distinguished singer – and in front of an audience of colleagues – but he quickly put each singer at ease and then proceeded to improve their singing in a thoroughly constructive fashion. A favourite piece of guidance from Mitch to singers., especially when it came to oratorio or songs, was “tell the story”. That was characteristically wise advice, once heard, never forgotten.   

      His relationship with Philomusica was a long one. At the invitation of our then conductor, Jim Cowley, he was our guest soloist in a performance of The Dream of Gerontius in Gloucester Cathedral in September 1982. He reprised the role for us in May 1993; that performance, too, was given in Gloucester Cathedral, a venue Mitch knew very well through his numerous Three Choirs Festival appearances over the years. When, in June 1997, Philomusica came to celebrate its 30th anniversary with a gala concert in Cheltenham Town Hall, our long association with the music of Elgar meant there was only one realistic repertoire choice for the celebratory concert: Mitch honoured us by singing the role of Gerontius once more. 

      There was one more Gerontius with Mitch, and what an occasion it was. In November 2006 we launched our 40th anniversary season with a performance of Elgar’s masterpiece in Tewkesbury Abbey, conducted by Linda. We made it a special celebration of Mitch, by now our President, and we joined forces with two other organisations with which he had special connections: Dean Close School Chapel Choir provided the semi chorus and the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama orchestra played for us. Mitch gave a wonderful performance and afterwards let it be known, discreetly, that he had decided this would be the last time he sang Gerontius.

      Mitch accepted our invitation to become a Vice President of Philomusica in 1996 and when John Miller retired in 2005, Mitch did us the honour of becoming our President. He was anything but a figurehead. Besides the performances of Gerontius, he sang as a guest in performances of Mendelssohn’s Elijah (2005) and Elgar’s Light of Life (2007), both in Tewkesbury Abbey. He also gave two rewarding – and entertaining -master classes for us, the second of which, in May 2003, was presented jointly with Maureen. He also was the principal soloist in two memorable gala recital evenings that we promoted at Dean Close School in 2002 and 2003. Just as important as those appearances was the constant stream of valuable advice he gave behind the scenes. He would never force his views on us but was always ready and willing to listen and offer sage advice when we asked for it.

      Mitch enjoyed life to the full. An important non-musical interest was football. He was a fine cook and was also appreciative of the cooking of others. In addition, he was partial to red wine and he knew a lot about the subject. He used to make regular visits to the Clos de Vougeot in Nuits-St Georges near Dijon and in 1991 he was honoured with admission to the ranks of the Chevaliers de la Confrerie des Chevaliers du Tastevin. 

      Mitch leaves a substantial legacy. An important element of that legacy lies in his commercial recordings on CD. There are also a substantial number of recordings made either in concerts or for the BBC; it would be wonderful if some of these were to appear on CD in due course. Another key part of his legacy lies in the memories which so many people will have of seeing and hearing him on the operatic stage or concert platform. One other key legacy is the influence he had on his pupils, many of whom are actively pursuing singing careers today, and on the young people and amateurs to whom he gave practical guidance and cheerful encouragement, often quite informally, over the years.

      In March 2012, on the occasion of his 80th birthday, we paid tribute Mitch – and to Maureen - with an unforgettable evening when we celebrated their wonderful careers. With minimal prompting they provided a rich and entertaining stream of memories and anecdotes – all delivered with characteristic modesty and humour – interspersed with extracts from some of their recordings to illustrate the greatness of their voices. On that occasion several significant figures from the musical world sent greetings to Mitch. Sir David Willcocks spoke of “his beautiful sound, allied to fine musicianship in his solo work.” His old friend, the distinguished bass-baritone, Raimund Herincx said “I am a great admirer of your voice, but with even more relevance, of your interpretive qualities.  It was always exciting and deeply satisfying to open up the soloists' entry in Verdi's Requiem.  Few British Tenors could ever match that sense of occasion.” Sir Brian McMaster, Director of both Welsh National Opera and the Edinburgh Festival, sent a joint greeting: “I don't think I have ever heard a voice as rich and of such quality as Maureen's and I yield to no-one in my admiration of, you, Mitch as a singer - the only one, I imagine, who sang both Tristan and Tonio in 'La Fille du Regiment' even if the latter only happened because you signed the contract before you looked at the score. As possibly the only person who heard both, I salute you today.” And the tenor, James Oxley, who at short notice sang for us so splendidly in our performance of The Kingdom in 2011, recalled a masterclass given by Mitch in Aberdeen in 1992: “I was wary of the bluff Northerner who spoke of things like chip butties, which were then, and now, unknown to me. Once the deceptive appearances were dispensed with, John turned out to be the most thoughtful and considerate of men: witty, perceptive, patient, demanding, and not at all afraid to show his feelings about the music he loved.”

      These tributes, and others paid on the occasion of his 80th birthday and since his death was announced, speak to the deep respect and affection in which Mitch was held within the music profession.

      The musical world has lost a great singer and teacher, who had a rich and fulfilling career and life. We in Philomusica have also lost a great friend. We extend our sincere condolences to Mitch’s sons, David and Mark, and to all his family.

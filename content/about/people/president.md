      “ Mitch ” as he is affectionately known to all is a vastly experienced musician with great knowledge of the whole classical music world.  

      He was THE Gerontius of his generation and Philomusica has been fortunate to share in some of these wonderful performances; particularly in a gala performance in November 2006 at Tewkesbury Abbey to launch our fortieth anniversary season.

      Besides Elgar Mitch is also well known for his singing of Wagner, Mahler (particularly “Das Lied von der Erde” where his recording with Alfreda Hodgson, conducted by Horenstein is regarded as the finest available), Schoenberg and Janacek.  He took part in the USA premiere of a new edition of Janacek’s “Slavonic Mass” with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by Sir Simon Rattle in 1998 having sung in the USA premiere of the first version of the work some 20 years previously.  

      He was Head of Vocal Studies at the Welsh College of Music and Drama until his retirement in 1997. He was actively involved with a Canadian company, KidsOp, who produce operas both aimed at and involving children.  He was the eponymous lead in “The Raven King” in 2000 and in 2001 was The Bear in “Coyote and the winter that never ends”.  

      It is impossible to capture all of Mitch ’s experience on one webpage so here are a few highlights of a glittering career.

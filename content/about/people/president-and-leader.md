      Christopher Horner was born in London and studied violin at the Centre for Young Musicians, Pimlico with Deryck Wareing, Henry Rubin and Eva Graubin. He furthered his studies with Eva Graubin whilst a student at the Royal Academy of Music, Surrey University and as a postgraduate in Barcelona. He has also received coaching advice from Hugh Bean.

      Christopher Horner has played as a recitalist, chamber musician and freelancer throughout the UK, in Europe, Asia and South Africa. He has broadcast on BBC Radio 3 and South African TV. Pianists with whom he works include John Lenehan, Lauretta Bloomer and Peter O’Hagan. He has worked extensively as a member of many chamber and symphony orchestras. Chamber ensembles include the PM Ensemble Cardiff and the Durban based contemporary music group Soundwaves.

      He performs a wide-ranging repertoire which has included giving the UK premieres of the works for violin and piano by the Lithuanian composer Juozas Gruodis (1884-1948). In 2004, in recognition of his advocacy of Gruodis, he had the distinction of being invited by the Lithuanian Academy of Music to perform in Vilnius where his recital with pianist Zoe Smith attracted much praise from authorities on the composer.

      Christopher was invited to teach at the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama in 1999, subsequently becoming Deputy Head of Strings the following year. He left the post in 2009 in order to return to a freelance career. He now teaches violin at Monmouth School for Girls, Monmouth School for Boys and coaches chamber music at the Junior Conservatoire of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.

      He has recently given recitals with pianists John Lenehan in the UK, including at St David's Hall Cardiff, and Elke Sanjosé in Barcelona. During the past year he has also given a number of recitals in Wales and England with guitarist John Mills. Next month he begins a tour to India as an Examiner for Trinity College London, with recitals and a recording project planned for the New Year.

      His CD of the Works for Violin and Piano by Juozas Gruodis with pianist John Lenehan is available on the Discovery Music and Vision and amazon websites via the following links:

      Appreciation

      “Christopher Horner is a very fine violinist and musician of  wide experience and broad outlook. He has a good sense of communication when performing. His violin playing evinces a serious and sincere musicianship and a well-founded technique which result in performances of intelligence and musical  integrity.” Hugh Bean CBE

      “Towering challenge of technical virtuosity met with an admirable artistry. Impressive…moods of tenderness, nostalgia, mystery, fun and frolic conveyed in generous measure leaving us certainly wanting more.”  Western Mail Cardiff

      “A violinist of intellect and distinction.” Peter Esswood, Cellist and Chairman of ESTA 2002-2004

      “The gyrations of a bird in flight were skilfully depicted by violinist Christopher Horner in The Lark Ascending”  Gloucestershire Echo

      “I and my Lithuanian colleagues were particularly taken with your brilliant playing of the sonata for violin and piano by Juozas Gruodis. You have masterfully solved all its problems. Your interpretation was not only technically flawless but also very interesting and convincing”  Algirdas Ambrazas Ethnomusicologist and Professor at the Lithuanian Academy of Music

      Linda is a professional musician who spends her life teaching, conducting, composing and performing.

      She began her musical studies at the Bromley Music Centre with Mavis Dean (Vocal) and Reginald Jeavons (Piano) and progressed to the Royal Academy of Music where her vocal coach was Bruce Boyce, the celebrated Canadian baritone.
      
      Since then she has continued her vocal studies with Roger Stalman at the Birmingham Conservatoire, Barry Faber at the Cheltenham Music Centre, James Walkley and John Mitchinson.
      
      She now teaches singing at Dean Close School in Cheltenham.

      She has also continued her piano studies with Geoffrey Pratley gaining her diploma for piano accompaniment from the Guildhall School of Music and has studied conducting technique with Anthony Negus of the Welsh National Opera.

      Linda has been Music Director for a number of choirs in the past notably The Jubilee Singers, a 50 strong mixed choir based in Cropredy, Oxfordshire and The Vocal Score, a chamber choir founded by Linda herself.

      Linda has written several 30 minute Christmas pieces which have been performed by Philomusica and other choirs, and arrangements of Folk Songs. 

      Her Tewkesbury Service was recently sung in the Abbey and she has just completed a setting of the Te Deum.

      Linda has sung with Philomusica as chorus member and soloist since 1975 ( singing in Gloucester Cathedral, Tewkesbury Abbey and Pershore Abbey) and has been the Conductor since 2001, directing works of many genres from Bach to Jonathan Willcocks as well as continuing the choir’s affinity with the English greats such as Elgar and Vaughan Williams. 

      She had the great privilege of conducting John Mitchinson’s last performance of Gerontius in 2006 with the Philomusica chorus, Dean Close School Chamber choir and the orchestra of the Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama.

      In her capable hands the choir goes from strength to strength and has received some glowing reviews.

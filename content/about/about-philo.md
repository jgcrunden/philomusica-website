      Philomusica exists to:
      - Sing good music well
      - Welcome all regardless of skill and experience
      - Foster an atmosphere of learning and enjoyment

      Philomusica has a set of core values which we hold dear:
      - To be supportive and inclusive
      - To provide good quality music
      - To develop and use our own soloists
      - To have a professional approach
      - To be financially sound
      - By staying true to these principles we have achieved a great deal since our formation in 1966.
      
      We have:

      - Built a choir of over 90 voices
      - Given over 900 concerts
      - Performed in major venues; Gloucester, Worcester & Hereford Cathedrals as well as Tewkesbury and Pershore Abbeys and Cheltenham Town Hall
      - Performed in a huge number of smaller venues and churches
      - Been on a number of overseas tours: France, Holland, Belgium & the USA
      - Given solo opportunities to many talented local singers
      - Raised thousands of pound for charity

      Right from the very start, we considered that the provision of a wide variety of  music and the giving of concerts in a multitude of venues, large and small, were vital aspects. Over time, through doing this, we've gained many friends and partners who help us achieve these objectives.&nbsp;
      
      We're a very friendly, forward-looking organisation that works hard to attract interest across the generations and cultures. So whatever your age or background, come and meet us, you'll be made very welcome.

    body: |
      It's that time of year again! Philomusica will be performing a selection of Christmas music, including your favourite carols! There will also be original compositions, including Linda's <em>Cradled in a Manger</em>.
      
      We will be performing as part of a fundraising event for Gloucester City Mission (GCM) at <b>7:30pm 1 December</b> at <b>St Barnabas' Church, Gloucester</b>. Please note, this is a <b>change of venue</b>; the performance is no longer at Gloucester Cathedral due to an administration error on the Cathedral's part.
      A poster can be found on on [GCM's website](https://www.gloscitymission.org.uk/fundraisingevents), however at the time of writing the venue has yet to be updated on their site.
      
      You can also hear us at <b>4pm on 10 December</b> at <b>St. Stephen's Barbourne, Worcester</b> and at <b>7:00pm on 13 December</b> at <b>Holy Trinity, Longlevens, Gloucester</b>. 
      Please check our [upcoming concerts page](/concerts/upcoming.html) for more details.

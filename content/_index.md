 - title: November's Concert
   body: What a spectacular evening!

    Despite the problems with the weather and flooding we had a full Abbey our soloists were absolutely on top form, the orchestra was wonderful, the choir sounded glorious and our masterful conductor reigned supreme. An evening to live in the memory.

      After a very successful performance of Handel's Messiah at St. Stephen's Barbourne and "Pip and Jim's", Cheltenham, Philomusica turns its attention to music for Spring 2024. These concerts will be given at St Stephen's on 24 February and at Holy Trinity, Longlevens on 9 March. The programme will include Gounod's St. Cecilia Mass and Linda Parsons' Tewkesbury Service. There is also one last chance to hear Philo before the end of the year; the choir will be performing as part of Gloucester City Mission's Christmas Carol Concert at Gloucester Cathedral. The concert starts at 7:30pm on 1 December. Please see the [Cathedral's website](https://gloucestercathedral.org.uk/whats-on/gloucester-city-mission-s-christmas-carol-concert) for more details.

  - title: Carmina Burana
    body: |
      Our next concert includes two showstopper works. <strong>Feel the Spirit by John Rutter</strong> is an exciting and lively suite of seven Spirituals. We’ve performed them several times in the past, both at home and on European tours, and audiences love them. We’ll also sing <strong>Carl Orff’s ever-popular Carmina Burana</strong>, one of the great favourites in the choral repertoire. The concert will take place in <strong>Pershore Abbey on Saturday 19 October</strong>. Please note the early start time of <strong>4pm</strong>.

      Tickets are now available!!! You can purchase them through our <a href="/tickets">online booking system</a>.
